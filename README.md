# Postman Builder

This is ALPHA and extreme WIP

Generate postman routes automatically based upon express routes

`npm i postman-builder -D`

Place `postmanbuilder.config.js` at root of your project with the following options:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  app: require(`./src/app`), // whever your express entrypoint exists
  collection: `collection name`, // postman collection name
  workspaceId: "", // workspace id generated by postman,
  postmanKey: "" // private api key provided by postman
};
```

Thank you to express-list-endpoints package for boilerplate to pull all endpoints:
